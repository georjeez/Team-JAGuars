            <h2>Facts about Jaguars</h2>
            <p>Jaguars are the third largest big cat in the world, with only tigers and lions  being larger. They stand up to 68 - 75 cm tall, and normally weigh around 56 - 97 kg. Female jaguars tend to be around 10-20% smaller than males. They also have the shortest tails of any big cat, theirs usually being around 45 - 75cm.</p>

            <h2>Jaguars are excellent swimmers</h2>
<p> Unlike many domestic cats, jaguars don’t avoid water. They have adapted to living in wet environments, and can be found swimming in lakes, rivers and wetlands. They are confident swimmers, known to cross large rivers.</p>

            <h2>They’re on the chunky side</h2>
<p>The jaguar is the third biggest cat in the world - after the tiger and the lion - and is the largest cat in the Americas. They can grow up to 170cm long, not including their impressive tails which can be up to 80cm. <br> Male jaguars can weigh 120kg (that’s almost 19 stone), while female jaguars can weigh much less, up to 100kg. But their sizes can vary a lot between regions - jaguars in central America can be roughly half the size of jaguars in the Pantanal. They need that bulk behind them to take on big prey, including giant caiman.</p>

            <h2>Their territory is shrinking</h2>
            <p>Jaguars used to be found from the south-west USA, throughout South America to almost the far north in Argentina. Now, they’ve been virtually eliminated from half of their historic range. There are around 173,000 jaguars left in the world today, and most of these big cats are found in the Amazon rainforest and the Pantanal, the largest tropical wetland. Their stronghold is in Brazil – it may hold around half of the estimated wild numbers.            </p>
