<h2>Appearance</h2>
    <h3>Size</h3>
        <p>Jaguars are the third largest big cat in the world, with only tigers and lions  being larger. They stand up to 68 - 75 cm tall, and normally weigh around 56 - 97 kg. Female jaguars tend to be around 10-20% smaller than males. They also have the shortest tails of any big cat, theirs usually being around 45 - 75cm.</p>
        <br>
    
    <h3>Coat</h3>
        <p>Their coat ranges from a pale yellow to tan or reddish-yellow, with a white underside covered in black spots. Spots and shapes vary. These patterns serve as camouflage in areas that have dense vegetation & patchy shadows.</p>

        <i>Did you know? 'Melanistic' jaguars and leopards are known as black panthers.</i>

    <h3>Similarities</h3>
        <p>Jaguars closely resemble leopards, but leopards tend to be stockier and have squarer heads. The rosettes on the jaguar's coat are larger, darker, fewer in number, and tend to have a small sot in the middle. They have powerful jaws and the third-highest bite force of all felines (after the tiger and lion).
